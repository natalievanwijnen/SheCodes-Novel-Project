          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <h3>
            An Atheist, a Priest, and the Art of Impersonating a Dead
            Receptionist
          </h3>
          <p class="synopsis">
            <span>
              In this “fun, page-turner of a novel” (Sarah Haywood, New York
              Times bestselling author) that's perfect for fans of Mostly Dead
              Things and Goodbye, Vitamin, a morbidly anxious young woman
              stumbles into a job as a receptionist at a Catholic church and
              soon finds herself obsessed with her predecessor's mysterious
              death.
              <br /><br />
            </span>
            Gilda, a twenty-something, atheist, animal-loving lesbian, cannot
            stop ruminating about death. Desperate for relief from her panicky
            mind and alienated from her repressive family, she responds to a
            flyer for free therapy at a local Catholic church, and finds herself
            being greeted by Father Jeff, who assumes she's there for a job
            interview. Too embarrassed to correct him, Gilda is abruptly hired
            to replace the recently deceased receptionist Grace.
            <br /><br />
            In between trying to memorize the lines to Catholic mass, hiding the
            fact that she has a new girlfriend, and erecting a dirty dish tower
            in her crumbling apartment, Gilda strikes up an email correspondence
            with Grace's old friend. She can't bear to ignore the kindly old
            woman, who has been trying to reach her friend through the church
            inbox, but she also can't bring herself to break the bad news.
            Desperate, she begins impersonating Grace via email. But when the
            police discover suspicious circumstances surrounding Grace's death,
            Gilda may have to finally reveal the truth of her mortifying
            existence.
