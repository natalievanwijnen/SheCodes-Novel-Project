        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p class="synopsis">
          Gilda, a twenty-something, atheist, animal-loving lesbian, cannot stop
          ruminating about death. Desperate for relief from her panicky mind and
          alienated from her repressive family, she responds to a flyer for free
          therapy at a local Catholic church, and finds herself being greeted by
          Father Jeff, who assumes she's there for a job interview. Too
          embarrassed to correct him, Gilda is abruptly hired to replace the
          recently deceased receptionist Grace.
          <br /><br />
          In between trying to memorize the lines to Catholic mass, hiding the
          fact that she has a new girlfriend, and erecting a dirty dish tower in
          her crumbling apartment, Gilda strikes up an email correspondence with
          Grace's old friend. She can't bear to ignore the kindly old woman, who
          has been trying to reach her friend through the church inbox, but she
          also can't bring herself to break the bad news. Desperate, she begins
          impersonating Grace via email. But when the police discover suspicious
          circumstances surrounding Grace's death, Gilda may have to finally
          reveal the truth of her mortifying existence.
